## ⚡ Quick start commands (Windows)

Run these in PowerShell before recording.

```powershell
# Backend
Set-Location D:\Studiess\Intern\Bluestock\backend
$env:PORT = "5000"
node src/server.js

# In a new terminal — Frontend
Set-Location D:\Studiess\Intern\Bluestock\frontend
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- If Firebase/Cloudinary creds are not set, backend runs in demo mode (safe for recording).
- Frontend will start at http://localhost:5173
- Backend API at http://localhost:5000/api

---

## 🗣️ 10-minute demo script (read‑aloud)

Use this word‑for‑word script. Total 10 minutes: 8 min frontend demo + 2 min code/logic.

### 00:00 – 00:20 Intro
Say: "Hello, I’m [Your Name]. This is my Bluestock warm‑up assignment. I’ll first demo the working module, then briefly walk through the code and logic."

Show: Browser with http://localhost:5173 open.

### 00:20 – 00:40 What you’ll see
Say: "I’ll show registration, login, the company profile dashboard with logo/banner upload, social links, and progress tracking. Then I’ll show the code structure and API briefly."

### 00:40 – 01:10 App overview
Say: "This is the landing/auth area. It’s built with React 18, Vite, and Material‑UI. State is handled with Redux Toolkit, server calls with React Query and Axios."

### 01:10 – 03:30 Registration flow (validations)
Action:
- Click Register.
- Intentionally submit with empty fields → show validation messages.
- Enter demo data:
   - Email: test.demo+now@example.com
   - Password: Demo1234!
   - Full name: Demo User
   - Mobile: +919876543210
   - Gender: Male
- Submit.

Say: "The form validates email format, strong password, and international mobile. On submit, the backend creates the user and returns a token."

Note (if needed): "If Firebase SMS isn’t configured, OTP is simulated in demo mode; core flow still works."

### 03:30 – 04:30 Login
Action:
- Go to Login, enter the same email and password, click Login.

Say: "On login, we store a JWT in localStorage via Axios interceptor and redirect to a protected dashboard route."

### 04:30 – 07:30 Dashboard: company profile setup
Action:
- Show 4 tabs: Company Info, Founding Info, Social Media, Contact.
- Company Info: fill Name, Address, City, Country, Website.
- Upload Logo and Banner.

Say: "Images upload to Cloudinary. If credentials aren’t present, the UI still shows preview and gracefully skips remote upload in demo mode."

- Social Media tab: add Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn links.
- Click Save/Update.

Say: "Setup progress updates in real time based on filled fields. Data persists via the API and refreshes correctly."

Show: progress bar increases; refresh the page to show persistence.

### 07:30 – 08:00 Wrap the user flow
Action: Optional logout/login again.

Say: "That’s the end‑to‑end user flow: register, login, set up company profile, upload images, manage social links, and track completion."

### 08:00 – 10:00 Code and logic (2 minutes)
Action: Switch to VS Code.

Say (Frontend): "Frontend is React + Vite. Structure under `frontend/src`: pages for Login/Register/Dashboard, `components/` like ImageUploader and ProtectedRoute, `store/` with `authSlice` and `companySlice`, and `api/axios.js` that injects the JWT."

Show:
- `frontend/src/api/axios.js`: request interceptor adding Authorization header.
- `frontend/src/store/authSlice.js`: loginSuccess reducer.
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`: tabbed layout + progress calculation.

Say (Backend): "Backend is Node/Express with PostgreSQL. Endpoints live in `backend/src/routes`, logic in `controllers`, and JWT auth middleware in `middleware/auth.js`. We validate input, prevent SQL injection via parameterized queries, and sanitize HTML."

Show:
- `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`: register/login function signature and bcrypt hashing.
- `backend/src/controllers/companyController.js`: update profile and progress calculation.
- `backend/src/server.js`: route mounting and security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate‑limit).

Say (Tests): "I added Jest + Supertest tests for auth and company endpoints, plus a Thunder Client collection for manual API checks."

Close (10:00): "Thanks for watching. Code, tests, and docs are in the repo. Happy to answer questions."

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Cloudinary Upload Requires Credentials

**Problem**: Image upload tests fail without Cloudinary credentials.

**Workaround for Demo**:
- Show that API endpoint exists and accepts data
- Use prepared base64 sample images
- Or use test Cloudinary account with public credentials

**Script**:
> "Image upload requires valid Cloudinary credentials. For security, these are in .env and not committed to repo. The endpoint is fully functional - here's a test upload with sample image data."

### Issue 2: Firebase OTP Verification

**Problem**: Actual SMS sending requires Firebase production setup.

**Workaround for Demo**:
- Show OTP generation and storage in database
- Demonstrate OTP verification with database-stored code
- Explain production would use Firebase SMS API

**Script**:
> "Mobile verification generates a 6-digit OTP stored in the database. In production, this would be sent via Firebase SMS. For development, we can see the OTP in the database and verify it manually."

### Issue 3: Email Verification Link

**Problem**: Requires Firebase email templates configured.

**Workaround for Demo**:
- Show endpoint exists
- Explain Firebase configuration needed
- Demonstrate database flag update

**Script**:
> "Email verification uses Firebase authentication links. The endpoint is implemented and updates the is_email_verified flag in the database."

---

## ❓ Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why did you choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?**

**A**: 
> "PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance, strong typing, and complex query support which are essential for company data management. The relational model ensures data integrity with foreign keys and constraints. Additionally, PostgreSQL 15 has excellent JSONB support for flexible fields like social_links, giving us both structure and flexibility."

**Q: How does JWT authentication work?**

**A**:
> "When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token containing the user ID and email, signed with a secret key. This token has a 90-day expiry. The client stores it in localStorage and sends it in the Authorization header for protected requests. The server verifies the signature and expiry on each request. This is stateless - no session storage needed on the server."

**Q: How do you prevent SQL injection?**

**A**:
> "We use parameterized queries exclusively. Instead of concatenating user input into SQL strings, we use placeholders ($1, $2, etc.) and pass values as parameters. The PostgreSQL driver handles proper escaping. For example: `pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', [email])`. This prevents any malicious SQL from being executed."

**Q: What testing strategy did you use?**

**A**:
> "We implemented unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest. Backend tests cover all API endpoints with valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and security scenarios like SQL injection and XSS. We have 32+ test cases with 80%+ coverage. Frontend testing is in progress using React Testing Library for component tests and Redux slice tests."

**Q: How do you handle file uploads?**

**A**:
> "Images are converted to base64 on the client, sent to our API, which uploads them to Cloudinary. Cloudinary handles optimization, resizing, and CDN delivery. We store only the Cloudinary URL in PostgreSQL. This keeps our database lightweight and leverages Cloudinary's image processing capabilities. Logo images are resized to 400x400px, banners to 1520x400px."

**Q: What security measures are in place?**

**A**:
> "Multiple layers: 
> 1. bcrypt password hashing with 10 rounds
> 2. JWT tokens with 90-day expiry
> 3. Input validation with express-validator
> 4. HTML sanitization to prevent XSS
> 5. Parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention
> 6. Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
> 7. Helmet for security headers
> 8. CORS configuration for allowed origins"

### Architecture Questions

**Q: Why Redux Toolkit and React Query together?**

**A**:
> "Redux Toolkit manages client state (user auth, UI state), while React Query handles server state (API data, caching, refetching). This separation of concerns makes the code cleaner. React Query provides automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates out of the box. Redux Toolkit simplifies state management with less boilerplate."

**Q: How scalable is this architecture?**

**A**:
> "The architecture supports horizontal scaling: 
> - Stateless backend (JWT, no sessions)
> - Database connection pooling (max 20 connections, easily increased)
> - CDN for images (Cloudinary)
> - Microservices-ready (separate auth and company services possible)
> - Can add Redis for caching
> - Load balancer can distribute across multiple Node instances"

**Q: How would you deploy this to production?**

**A**:
> "Deployment strategy:
> - Backend: Docker container on AWS EC2 or Heroku
> - Frontend: Static build on Vercel or Netlify with CDN
> - Database: AWS RDS PostgreSQL with automated backups
> - Environment variables via platform secrets
> - CI/CD with GitHub Actions
> - Monitoring with PM2 and logging with Winston
> - SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
> - Cloudflare for DDoS protection"

### Business Logic Questions

**Q: How is setup progress calculated?**

**A**:
> "Setup progress tracks 13 fields in the company profile: logo, banner, company name, address, city, state, country, postal_code, website, industry, founded_date, description, and social_links. Progress = (filled_fields / 13) × 100. It's calculated on every profile update. When progress reaches 100%, is_complete flag is set to true."

**Q: Can a user have multiple companies?**

**A**:
> "Currently, it's one-to-one: one user owns one company profile. This is enforced by the unique owner_id foreign key. To support multiple companies, we'd change to one-to-many: add a company_id selector in the dashboard, allow creating multiple profiles, and update queries to filter by selected company."
